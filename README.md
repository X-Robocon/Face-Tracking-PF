# Face-Tracking-PF
This repo is an implementation of an integrated face tracker using color-based and moment-based particle filters. To test the functionality of the face tracker, videos of moving faces are fed into the system. Particles are in the represention of bounding boxes with different colors. The code is mainly done in Matlab.

## Contents
* In the "code" folder, run the script main_ICM.m to see how the integrated face tracker works; run the script main_clr.m to see how the color-based face tracker works alone.
* In the "videos" folder, "sample3.mp4" and "sample4.mp4" are input videos, and others are outputs from the face tracking system.
* In the "doc" folder, you can find the [report](https://github.com/txzhao/Face-Tracking-PF/blob/master/doc/report.pdf) with more details.
