# Face-Tracking-PF
This repo is an implementation of an integrated face tracker using color-based and moment-based particle filters. To test the functionality of the face tracker, videos of moving faces are fed into the system. Particles are in the represention of bounding boxes with different colors. The code is mainly done in Matlab.
